                <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdownRule5">
                    <p>I know The Uranium Network is a lot more open and free speech basically, but I want 0 association or any hearing about any projects or Discord Servers runned by Yae Mica / Bionic Butter / Klee, etc unless if your showing something like Bionic's BioniDKU project either in a vm or your desktop, thats completely fine of course. This is just another server of mine that I want to succeed on its own without any association. </p>

                <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdownRule6">
                    <p>I am fine with the sus stuff most of the time (like if Julia says something questionable) but if it goes too far immediately or overtime, for example (I want to f**k ___, I want to see ____ wearing/in ____, or I cannot wait to have s*x with ____). Thats not okay, especially when theres adults like myself and Julia in the server who have laws that basically cover that any sexual interactions with minors over the internet or actually just in general. That can cause us to go to jail. </p>

                <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdownRule7">
                    <p>We all have our own opinions, you have to respect them at the end of the day. If you disagree with someone, do your best to not upset them about their own opinion. The said person might react or get offended by it, which obviously will break this rule + Rule 3 slightly. We want everyone to feel happy talking to each other not make someone upset or annoyed from it. I've seen it happen a couple of times already sadly :( </p>

                    <p>Follow Discord TOS (https://discord.com/terms) and Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines), we all obviously use Discord, however we must follow and respect what is written and what is in place.
